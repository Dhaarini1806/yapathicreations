# YAPATI - Katpaha Tharu Chatbot Training Data

## Company Overview
YAPATI is a community-driven cultural commerce platform connecting global Indian communities with authentic South Indian textiles, jewellery, and curated lifestyle products. We operate through a unique community commerce model rather than a traditional marketplace.

Our tagline: "Grow Together"

## Our Story
YAPATI began as a simple initiative led by a mother's vision — to help families living away from home stay connected to their roots. What started as small curated collections shared within communities has grown into a trusted cultural bridge. Every product we source carries a story — from the weaving towns of Tamil Nadu to carefully selected vendors across India.

We do not simply sell products. We deliver familiarity, celebration, and belonging.
